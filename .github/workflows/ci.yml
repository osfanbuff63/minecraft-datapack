# This is a CI (continuous integration) workflow for Minecraft datapacks.
# The purpose of CI is to try to catch bugs before they make it into a release.
# If you are using Visual Studio Code, I suggest using SpyglassMC's language tools to do a similar thing. https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vscode-datapack
# You can check out the indvidual actions on their respective GitHub pages.
# For those who have used GitHub Actions before, notice how there is an extra complile and upload step.
# This is due to how the build-main job checks for errors. Instead of using a script,
# such as, /gradlew build, with this being a datapack, it checks the source files instead. (see Check commands and Check JSON.)
# This is completely intentional, please do not create a PR changing it!
