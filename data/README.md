# Namespaces

Datapacks are split up into **namespaces**. In this example, we use the `minecraft` namespace, and our own namespace, in this case `example_datapack`. Use the `minecraft` namespace to override vanilla, and your own to add new features.

> [!WARNING]
> **Do NOT include Minecraft's vanilla datapack in a custom datapack! This is a violation of the Minecraft EULA!**
